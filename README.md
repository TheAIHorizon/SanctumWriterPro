## 💰 Pricing

SanctumWriter Pro itself has no license fee to use from this repository (see
[License](#-license) — licensing terms are still pending). You only pay for
the cloud API usage:

| Provider | Approximate Cost |
|----------|------------------|
| OpenRouter | Varies by model ($0.10 - $15 per 1M tokens) |
| OpenAI GPT-4o | ~$5 per 1M tokens |
| Anthropic Claude 3.5 | ~$3 per 1M tokens |
| Google Gemini | Often free tier available |

💡 **Tip**: For most writing, a few dollars goes a long way. A typical document edit costs fractions of a cent.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **API keys stored locally** in your browser's localStorage
- **Keys sent directly to providers** - we never see them
- **No telemetry** - we don't track your usage
- **Source-visible** - the code in this repository is publicly readable so you
  can audit it yourself (this is not a statement about license/reuse rights —
  see [License](#-license))

For maximum privacy, use the [free SanctumWriter](https://github.com/TheAIHorizon/SanctumWriter) with local models.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API key required"
Add your API key in **Settings → API Keys** for the provider you want to use.

### "Need API Key" in provider menu
The provider is available but not configured. Click it anyway, then add your key in Settings.

### Models not loading
1. Check your API key is correct
2. Verify the provider's service is operational
3. Some providers require billing setup before API works

### Want to use local models?
Local providers (Ollama, LM Studio) still work! They're in the "Local (Free)" section of the provider menu.
